# Dynamic React Landing Page with Django 🚀
This is my first React project, a modern and responsive eCommerce landing page built using React.js. The design is sleek, featuring a Nike shoe store layout, with a focus on clean UI/UX and smooth interactivity.
This project is a fully dynamic landing page built with React (Frontend) and Django (Backend). The goal is to allow administrators to modify landing page content (logo, navigation menu, hero section, buttons, and icons) directly from the Django Admin Panel, eliminating the need for manual code changes.
